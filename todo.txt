TODO
--------
 - Segregate the reading of report /field data etc into a seperate module which reads into an array of records   - I have briefly started work on m002_DataAccess

 - Continue to work on generating EntryPoints\GenerateReport
        - Set properties of pivot table (see empty CustomisePivotTable Sub)

  - ReportsField tab --> Do not allow columns as data orientation (they would need some sort of sum or someting anyway and this generates VBA error).  Better practice to have measure as data anyway.
     - Conditional formatting on the error formula already created
     - run check before running macro

- See ReportList tab.  Reports are run from here.  Link this to Report dependency tab which will then drive refresh


- Power Query Consolidated Files in Folder
    - add functionality to select only first row of data if flag is set (don't want to return empty tables as will throw errors in power pivot lookup tables).   Pick up first row of first file only, don't expand all files
    - maybe first create the functionality to do this on a single file?






 - Create code to update / overwrite fn_std power queries in this workbook to the active workbook


 - Create generic code to check for items in data tables not in lookup tables using EXCEPT function
 
- create code to generate dax query table on worksheet 

  - Create code for DAX query link back table in seperate file to avoid bloating working model file --> don't think it will be that practical putting in a seperate file but potentially could be better codified.
  
  - - Create code to set up a model sheet (containing all the required tables e.g. Paramaters, ReportFields, ReportDependencies) - most probably a lot easier to just save as a template somewhere but then I cannot generalise onto github.  Most probably lower priority
  
  
  In the date table - is there an issue with using list.dates - see comment from Ken Puls here
