TODO
--------

 - Continue to work on generating EntryPoints\GenerateReport
        -  See module ZZZ_Testing for hiding details (=collapsing rows and fields) and hiding subtotals
        - How do I collapse multiple items on row or column?  Drilldown seems to only handle one --> only way I can see how to do this is set drill down for the pvot field as false.  Then loop and set relevant items as true
        - set pivot field number format
        - Set other properties of pivot table (see empty CustomisePivotTable Sub)


- Power Query Consolidated Files in Folder
 - use table.First 
    - add functionality to select only first row of data if flag is set (don't want to return empty tables as will throw errors in power pivot lookup tables).   Pick up first row of first file only, don't expand all files

    - maybe first create the functionality to do this on a single file?

Data_Access power queries should provide access to all fields and rows without filters.  Filters, combining etc can be applied in other queries 

 - Create code to update / overwrite fn_std power queries in this workbook to the active workbook


 - Create generic code to check for items in data tables not in lookup tables using EXCEPT function


  - Create code for DAX query link back table in seperate file to avoid bloating working model file --> don't think it will be that practical putting in a seperate file but potentially could be better codified --> maybe rather work in techniques for faster power queries rather than complications of link back tables.

- create code to generate dax query table on worksheet   
  
  In the date table - is there an issue with using list.dates - see comment from Ken Puls here

 -   See if I can add table name to the measures output written to spreadsheet
