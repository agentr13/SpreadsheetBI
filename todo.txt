TODO

Currently I am handling the LoadData option differently for consolidated and single files remedy as below:
 - route all DataAccess_XXX queries through fn_ConsolidatedFilesInFolder
 - Create 2 additional fn_Single files that take 2 parameters
     * read tabular specific sheet
     * read tabular specific table
 - pass this additional table  / sheet name to consolidated file as an additional paramter
 

 - Create a DataAccessQueries tab to designate queries for loading
 
 - Create an associated function to pick up Load / No Load from above.

- Create query templates for standard data queries? 

- ensure vba and power query exports are to active file ditectory

 - Continue to work on generating EntryPoints\GenerateReport
        
        - Set other properties of pivot table (see empty CustomisePivotTable Sub) for example
            - Freeze pane cell
             - Column Widths?

 - See QueryFlow.pdf

 - Create generic code to check for items in data tables not in lookup tables using EXCEPT function
