TODO

 - Need to roll out changes

  
   - Is it worthwhile considering list.accumulate in power query rather than a VBA solution
    * This will also allow easier to transition to power BI
    
  
 - Work on the VBA or power query looper solution depending outcome of above
 
  - Look at Tabular editor
    https://exceleratorbi.com.au/introduction-to-tabular-editor-for-business-users/
 
 - Create a flat pivot style (and apply when flatten pivot table macro is run)
 
  In the date table - is there an issue with using list.dates - see comment from Ken Puls here
