 - What is the best way to update the standard queries (given that some query names may also change) - potentially the below, hopefully something not required very often?
  (Ideally one or 2 queries can simply be updated with a copy and paste)
   * Export all non-standard queries
   * Delete all queries (how do I easily do this given potential query dependencies)
   * Reload new standard queries
   * Reload previous non-standard queries
 

 - Continue to work on generating EntryPoints\GenerateReport
        
        - Set other properties of pivot table (see empty CustomisePivotTable Sub) for example
            - Freeze pane cell
             - Column Widths?

 - See QueryFlow.pdf

 - Create generic code to check for items in data tables not in lookup tables using EXCEPT function


  - Create code for DAX query link back table and ability to import and  export the relevant dax code

- create code to generate dax query table on worksheet
