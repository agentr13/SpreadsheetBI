TODO
------- 
 - Create sample chart of accounts CSV using macro that genenerates CSV from table
 
 - Create sample trial balances using macro that generates CSV from table
 
- Create a trial balance measure 

- Create a p&l measure based off trial balance dependent on time period selected 

 - In respect of the missing lookups and missing lookup checks --> return OK if data load is set to fals, irrespective of whether there is a lookup missing
 
  - The sub that writes relationships, measures calculated columns to spreadsheet throws errors if none exist in each of these categories
 
 - For "Create BI Spreadsheet" --> switch back to using VBA to copy queries across.  The copy and paste option seems to add an extra layer of let...in source to some functions which is just confusing
 
   - Is it worthwhile considering list.accumulate in power query rather than a VBA solution
    * This will also allow easier to transition to power BI
  
 - Wondering if I should go back and re-evaluate auto repoert creation.  Won't necessarily complete each time a report is run but useful for recreating the entire spreadsheet.
    * Ideally I would also have code that read the pivot report settings into an Excel Lisbobject.   Which could then be used to recreate the pivot reports
  
  
 - Work on the VBA or power query looper solution depending outcome of above
 
  - Look at Tabular editor
    https://exceleratorbi.com.au/introduction-to-tabular-editor-for-business-users/
 
 - Create a flat pivot style (and apply when flatten pivot table macro is run)
 
  In the date table - is there an issue with using list.dates - see comment from Ken Puls here
