TODO
-------
 
  - Is it worthwhile creating VBA that generates power query code that creates a table (table created by code - not imported from spreadsheet)
    * will first need to add the new sheet in createspreadsheet BI   --> DONE
    * Change the way types are currently ascribed as this does not generate error if incorrect data types.
    * Rather first create table with table from records adn then transform data types
    * redo current tables like number scale, example_dataTable, example_LookupTable, TimePeriods
 
 - Is it worthwhile considering list.accumulate in power query rather than a VBA solution
    * This will also allow easier to transition to power BI

  - Consider using power query paramaters (rather than read parameter from Excel sheet) - that way I can copy and paste queries and paramaters to and from power BI see below:

 - Work on the VBA or power query looper solution depending outcome of above
 
 - Create a flat pivot style (and apply when flatten pivot table macro is run)
 
  In the date table - is there an issue with using list.dates - see comment from Ken Puls here
