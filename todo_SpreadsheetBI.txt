TODO
------- 
 - Move the power queries and DAX measures into a seperate workbook

  - Delete power queries from Spreadsheet BI

 - Don't forget to use DAX studio for debugging, performance measurement and measure creation

 - Read in sample financial data
    * Do I want to do this in spreadsheetBI?
    * Maybe move all power query and 
    * Need to make path relative.

- Create a trial balance measure 

 - Create measure check to ensure that TB = sum of journals
 
  Create a p&l measure based off trial balance dependent on time period selected 
  ( Create P&L monthly, quarterly annually and PY measures)
  
  - Create BS measure

 - Create a readme

 - In respect of the missing lookups measure and missing lookup checks --> return OK if data load is set to false, irrespective of whether there is a lookup missing

 - Create a release section in github

  - The sub that writes relationships, measures calculated columns to spreadsheet throws errors if none exist in each of these categories
 
  
   - Is it worthwhile considering list.accumulate in power query rather than a VBA solution
    * This will also allow easier to transition to power BI
  
 - Wondering if I should go back and re-evaluate auto repoert creation.  Won't necessarily complete each time a report is run but useful for recreating the entire spreadsheet.
    * Ideally I would also have code that read the pivot report settings into an Excel Lisbobject.   Which could then be used to recreate the pivot reports
  
  
 - Work on the VBA or power query looper solution depending outcome of above
 
 - Create a flat pivot style (and apply when flatten pivot table macro is run)
 
  In the date table - is there an issue with using list.dates - see comment from Ken Puls here
