TODO
------- 
- potentially include model info like dax measures etc as pipe delimited spreadsheet meta data rather than writing to spreadsheet itself. 
  - Under data model create
         (i) WriteModelMeasuresToPipeDelimtedText DONE
         (ii) WriteModelCalcColsToPipeDelimitedFile DONE
         (iii) WriteModelColsToPipeDelimitedSheet
         (iv) WriteRelationshipsToPipeDelimitedSheet
    Once above is complete add this to meta data generating sub

 - Also create a more human readable dax measure output
     (single file of measures with spaces between)
     (also run via metadata generating sub)

  - Create a readme
  
 - Create a release section in github

  - The sub that writes relationships, measures calculated columns to spreadsheet throws errors if none exist in each of these categories
 
  
   - Is it worthwhile considering list.accumulate in power query rather than a VBA solution
    * This will also allow easier to transition to power BI
  
 - Wondering if I should go back and re-evaluate auto repoert creation.  Won't necessarily complete each time a report is run but useful for recreating the entire spreadsheet.
    * Ideally I would also have code that read the pivot report settings into an Excel Lisbobject.   Which could then be used to recreate the pivot reports
  
  
 - Work on the VBA or power query looper solution depending outcome of above
 
 - Create a flat pivot style (and apply when flatten pivot table macro is run)
 
  In the date table - is there an issue with using list.dates - see comment from Ken Puls here
